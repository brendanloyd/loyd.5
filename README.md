Problems:

I had this project running well printing to the resource file up until a certain point. 
Inbetween changes somehow my shared memory got messed up and I started recieving errors.
I couldn't pin point what was going on because sometimes one part would throw an error then another.
If I could get the shared memory working properly this would be running near specifications.
The program does compile.
